# FetchRewardsInterview

This exercise shows a web service to determine if an input word is a pyramid word. A pyramid word has letters with distinct and continuous frequencies starting from 1 occurrence. 

## Installation

This project uses the Spring framework and the Maven build tool within Java 8.  

If you do not have Java 8 installed, visit this link: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase-jdk8-downloads.html. 

If you do not have Maven installed, download and follow installation instructions for Maven here: https://maven.apache.org/

To use these files, download or clone this Github repository. 


## Usage

To use the service, open the files within your IDE and run the FetchRewardsPyramidServiceApplication.

Once the build is complete and the service is running, start a browser. 

In a browser, go to localhost:8080/isPyramid/{insert word here}, where {insert word here} is the word to check for pyramid status. 

The browser will output true if the word is a pyramid and false if it is not a pyramid.
